<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>L001</FONT></b>: "Innocence" by Nina Rune Essendrop; presented by Lizzie Stark. A LARP from the mind of Nina Rune Essendrop, one of the creators of White Death. A poetic, nonverbal, very physical LARP about naive creatures called Clowns. The Clowns have very short memories - they always wake up to a brand new world. Now, the Circus - their purpose and home - has left. The Salesman enters to offer language and independence in return for their dreams about the Circus and their painfully important relationships to one another. The Clowns will have to decide whether to take the easy way out with the Salesman, or whether to stay, despite their difficulties, and wait for the Circus to return. Clown noses, mirrors, and string (for making tangled, snarled relationships with other clowns) will be provided. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 8:00PM - 12:00AM</FONT></b>; One Round; All Materials Provided. Beginners Welcome; Serious, 18 & Over ONLY.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>L002</FONT></b>: "No Further Questions" by Jeff Dieterle and Chad Wolf; presented by Chad Wolf. A low-commitment, drop-in/drop-out party LARP about people holding press conferences that don't need to be held and the reporters on the scene asking the questions no one needs to ask. If you've ever wanted to ask a baseball manager about the joint custody arrangement after his octogenarian parents' divorce, this is the game for you. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 8:00PM - 10:00PM</FONT></b>; One Round; All Materials Provided.

Traditionally the Council makes decisions for the 500-plus member community - the Family, really - but nothing is ever done without the approval of Meade. Lately the leader has been growing more and more erratic and unstable. Meade has called together the Council. Will it be for the last time? <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 8:00PM - 10:00PM</FONT></b>; One Round; All Materials Provided.

Winner of the 2017 Golden Cobra Challenge award for Best Game That Incorporates Meaningful, Non-Romantic Relationships. The Long Drive Back from Busan is about a male k-pop group struggling to fulfill the demands presented by the Korean entertainment industry. Faced with obsessive fans, a domineering manager, family problems, mental health issues, and a talent agency that controls their every move, can the boys band together to support each other in this tumultuous career, or will it be too much for them? All characters are male. Content Warning: Emotional abuse, eating disorders, body shaming, depression. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 8:00PM - 12:00AM</FONT></b>; One Round; All Materials Provided.

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>L005</FONT></b>: The Burning Wheel; "Inheritance" by Burning Wheel Headquarters; presented by Mel White. In Jutland, in the far distant past, when Christianity barely eking out a toe hold among the inhabitants, a family gathers upon the death of its patriarch. For some, it is farewell; for others, it is in hopes of the future. Inheritance tells the tale of a family coming to terms with forgiveness, debt, religion, law and death. Published by Burning Wheel HQ and based on the Burning Wheel role playing game, players each receive a booklet and a deck of cards to represent their characters. That's essentially all that is needed to play. No experience, knowledge, dice, pencils, paper or costumes are required; all that is needed is a willingness to fight for what you believe! <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 8:00PM - 12:00AM</FONT></b>; One Round; All Materials Provided. Beginners Welcome; Serious, 18 & Over ONLY.<FONT COLOR='RED'> ONLY ONE SEAT LEFT!</FONT><p>

It's a game about queerness, prayer and spirituality.

<img src='/images/lock.gif'> <FONT COLOR='RED'>L008</FONT>: "Good Society" by Storybrewers Roleplaying; presented by James Stuart. A LARP that seeks to capture the heart, and the countenance, of Jane Austen's work. It is a game of balls, estates, sly glances, and turns about the garden.

This is a playtest of the LARP rules written by the Storybrewers for their game Good Society. No costuming or prep needed. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 9:00AM - 1:00PM</FONT></b>; One Round; All Materials Provided.

Beginners Welcome; Fun, All Ages.<p>

Nominally, party attendees are there to support the expectant parents, but during play you will use the occasion to vent frustrations and resentments with other party guests in the pettiest, most pass-aggressive manner possible. The game will end when the gender reveal goes hilariously wrong and the party-goers burn down the forest. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 9:00AM - 1:00PM</FONT></b>; One Round; All Materials Provided.

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>R268</FONT></b>: "First Day Out" by Secret Orbit Studios; presented by Rick Dean. An INDEPENDENTLY PUBLISHED GAME - Part of the Indie Games Explosion! A short, slice of life game about a released prisoner's first day out of prison. Players take turns portraying the "unbound" while the other players act as the "world" enacting forces upon them. This game has some heavy overtones but also has the potential for humorous, hopeful, and heartfelt moments. It is greatly indebted to Jackson Tegu's "Morning" in that the game is played out in brief, unconnected glimpses and impressions throughout the unbound's first day out. Sprawling narrative and fantastical occurrences are absent, replaced by brief flashes of emotion, sensation, and thought. First Day Out is a meditative game about sensing the real world in new, bewildering ways. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 12:00AM - 2:00AM</FONT></b>; One Round; All Materials Provided.

The algorithm organizes its citizens into small, distributed communities, which are capable of carrying out what seems to be the algorithm's primary objective: Dismantling the powerful corporations that dominate daily life on Earth. Some of these objectives are straightforward objectives, but rarely, a Key Quest will appear, indicating that the network is ready to enter a new phase of its existence. Recently, the network has been growing rapidly and expanding its reach. The community has a sense of building to something major when a new Key Quest appears.

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>B314</FONT></b>: Super Rhino Hero. <a href='http://www.dexposure.com/envoy' target='NEW'>An Envoy Event!</a> Players are presented with an incredibly heroic – and regrettably heavy – rhinoceros who is eager to climb a tall building and leap other tall buildings in a single bound. First, though, you need to construct that building. Players each start the game with five roof cards, and they take turns adding walls and roofs to a single building. On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall. Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card. In addition, some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on the tower. Keep your hands steady! The first player to build all of his roof cards wins the game. Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards in hand wins. This event will be played with the GIANT Japanese set! <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 8:00PM - 10:00PM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided. Beginners Welcome; Fun, All Ages.

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>B356</FONT></b>: Can't Stop. In this Sid Sackson classic, there's a board with all the possible results of two six-sided dice: two through twelve. The object of the game is to move a little marker to the top of three columns by rolling that result, but you need many more sevens than you need twelves, based on the likelihood of each result. During your turn, you roll the dice and place temporary markers onto the board. You can continue moving these markers until either none of your dice match (your turn is over and all progress you've made is gone), or cut your losses and end your turn (placing a permanent marker in your rows). <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 9:00AM - 11:00AM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided.

<img src='/images/lock.gif'> <FONT COLOR='RED'>B606</FONT>: Spring Meadow. <a href='http://www.dexposure.com/envoy' target='NEW'>An Envoy Event!</a> The first delicate flowers herald the end of a harsh winter. The sun shines longer day by day and pushes the snow back. Lush meadows bloom, and curious marmots slowly awaken from hibernation. Finally, spring is coming into the mountains - the perfect time for a hike. Choose your route carefully, watch out for the burrows of the marmots, and pack enough snacks. Your chances to earn an edelweiss hiking pin are rather low if you sit hungry in the snow. Spring Meadow is the grand finale of Uwe Rosenberg's puzzle trilogy following 2016's Cottage Garden and 2017's Indian Summer. The complexity of this game - the most interactive of the trilogy - is set in between those two games, and fans of the trilogy will find familiar elements combined in an innovative way. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 11:00AM - 1:00PM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided.

These cards are then placed in a discard pile, and the previously played cards recovered for the subsequent round. Each company has a double-sided company track, so games will vary quite a lot based on which tracks are revealed and at which companies they are placed. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 2:00PM - 6:00PM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided.
