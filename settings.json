This is a lighter, satirical game that is welcoming for first-time larpers. This game is in late-stage playtesting. Video recording is a core mechanic in this game so must consent to be recorded. Said video may remain private after the game if players decide so.",

The military only tolerated these women because they needed the numbers; by regulation they were still classified as mentally ill and the threat of a dishonorable discharge was real. Sometimes that threat meant making the hard choice between doing the right thing, and surviving as a queer woman in the army.

After they are married, two people join hands and a biological process takes place which permanently joins the hands together. Until recently, if anything separated them, both vespers died. A new medical breakthrough has allowed two vespers to become separated surgically, and as long as both are joined to new partners immediately. The hope that this procedure brought for many unhappy couples was quickly dashed as governments around the planet placed onerous restrictions on the procedure. The government demands high fees and requires participants to meet through a government sanctioned speed dating event. Unlike most speed dating, this is a high stakes event. If two people match but their spouses do not find someone new, then the two that matched can force the surgery to happen, causing the death of their former spouses. Additionally, participants will have paid the price for the surgery, regardless of whether they find a new partner or not.",

With no radio or other means of communicating with the outside world, it is unclear to all of you whether this is a drill, a mistake, or the real deal. As the hours pass and the possibility of nuclear annihilation grows more real, will you open up to people you never thought you would trust, dismantle the school's social hierarchy as you know it, and say all the things you meant to keep secret?",

They do not stay in touch as much as they would like, but the sauna evening is a tradition from the days of old. Back then they shared dreams and desires, but the years have taken their toll. Sitting in the steaming sauna, all of them are pondering: What can I tell the others? What will they think of me? And in the end, will they be there for me? This scenario is about the difficulty of talking and opening up. In Finnish culture, sauna is something that removes social boundaries. It's a place where everybody is equal. Rank, wealth, and seniority carry no weight there. Everybody is naked, both physically and mentally. You are not in a hurry. And in this place alone you can cast away the stoic shell that our society expects of our men. (Note: No actual player nudity in this game.)",

In a pre-game workshop, each character receives \"the talk\" - an awkward conversation about sex from an adult that reflects the adult's perspective on sexuality. During the game, the characters explore their own understanding of sexuality, challenge what they were told during \"the talk,\" share knowledge, and apply that knowledge through a series of party games and organic conversations. The Sleepover is also about how we apply what we know about sex and gender in real situations. In the game, characters will navigate their comfort with intimacy and sex through various mini-games that are sometimes played at teen parties. This gives the characters a chance to experiment with how to communicate sexual interest, negotiate consent, and understand what sexuality means for them. This game affirms, explores, and celebrates queer sexuality and queerness. The Sleepover is part of \"Honey & Hot Wax: An Anthology of Erotic Art Games\", an upcoming anthology published by Pelgrane Press, with support from the Effing Foundation for Sex Positivity.",

Those who perished, in one of the most horrific industrial disasters in America, were some of the most vulnerable and unprotected individuals. The dead left behind families they supported, dreams of a better life, and the hope to finally escape from poverty and oppression. Where these workers came from, what they aspired for, and what kept them physically and socially trapped is what this game comes to explore. You will play as an employee for a company, dealing with juggling your job, your own dreams, and the day to day struggles which keep you trapped. This game does require manual dexterity.",

At first glance, it's a normal situation, best left to local authorities: high school gymnast, a hopeful for 2024 Olympics team, goes missing. Her relative fame is the only reason your group of 'Paranormal Investigators' (although most just call you lunatics) even found out about the small Maine town. But records indicate a beloved teen disappearing from the town every 20 years, almost to the day. If the past is any indication, next comes reports of strange creatures crawling out of the sea, residents experiencing bizarre physical transformations, and finally, a mass disappearance of over thirty people. That is, unless your team can stop it. But what is causing these strange events? How can you fight something, when you don't know what you're looking for?",

You play individuals from an outpost Martian community of miners and convicts exploited for brutal work in dangerous conditions, seizing a fragment of hope for asylum on Earth. What will you find in your moments of liberation? Who will you have by your side? This is a collaborative tragedy and epic journey inspired by the structured freeform design of Montsegur 1244.

On March 25, 1911, in just fifteen minutes, 146 workers in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory died because of greed. Those who perished, in one of the most horrific industrial disasters in America, were some of the most vulnerable and unprotected individuals. The dead left behind families they supported, dreams of a better life, and the hope to finally escape from poverty and oppression. Where these workers came from, what they aspired for, and what kept them physically and socially trapped is what this game comes to explore. You will play as an employee for a company, dealing with juggling your job, your own dreams, and the day to day struggles which keep you trapped. This game does require manual dexterity.",

First, though, you need to construct that building. Players each start the game with five roof cards, and they take turns adding walls and roofs to a single building. On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall. Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card. In addition, some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on the tower. Keep your hands steady! The first player to build all of his roof cards wins the game. Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards in hand wins.",

      "description": "An Envoy Event! A cooperative game from R&R Games in which players try to create the perfect fireworks show by placing the cards on the table in the right order. The card deck consists of five different colors of cards, numbered 1–5 in each color. For each color, the players try to place a row in the correct order from 1–5. Sounds easy, right? Well, not quite, as in this game you hold your cards so that they're visible only to other players. To assist other players in playing a card, you must give them hints regarding the numbers or the colors of their cards. Players must act as a team to avoid errors and to finish the fireworks display before they run out of cards.",

On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall. Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card. In addition, some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on the tower. Keep your hands steady! The first player to build all of his roof cards wins the game. Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards in hand wins.",

But these outer systems are not yet strong enough to engage the forces of the Core Worlds directly.

Players use water in LEO as currency to bid on space-related patents for thrusters, refineries, and robotics. Putting together a functional craft is not easy, as the heavier the craft becomes, the less maneuverable it is and the more fuel (also water in LEO) the craft will require, so players have to balance useful heavy parts with lighter, less functional parts. Victory points are awarded for successful mineral extractions, and for being the first to reach key technologies and exploration points in the solar system.",

The Secretary General calls for calm, but before he can order a recess, his cranium is split as well.

First, though, you need to construct that building. Players each start the game with five roof cards, and they take turns adding walls and roofs to a single building. On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall. Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card. In addition, some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on the tower. Keep your hands steady! The first player to build all of his roof cards wins the game. Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards in hand wins.",

As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone.

The Secretary General calls for calm, but before he can order a recess, his cranium is split as well. The remaining Great Powers use the confusion to pass the gavel between themselves, conduct international business amidst the chaos, and generally try to shift the balance of world power while escaping a bunch of armed psychopaths.",

      "description": "In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new \"superpowers\" scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.",

Complete these tasks while racing against the timer. You get a point for each sphere you use and a bonus token for using all five colors, but you lose two points for each task card you don't follow correctly. Prove to your opponents that you are the master of multi-dimensional thinking!

Each turn, you select one of your characters and perform two actions. Each character has access to basic actions like moving and challenges as well as several unique abilities that may be performed only by spending ability tokens. Funkoverse uses an innovative \"cooldown\" system - the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again - so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique.",
