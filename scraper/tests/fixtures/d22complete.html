<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>Q004</FONT></b>: <FONT COLOR='YELLOW'>"Broketown Drift: A Post-Apocalyptic LARP" presented by Anne Ratchat, James Mendez Hodes. A DEXCON 22 EXCLUSIVE! An original LARP inspired by Mad Max and the works of Avery Alder. Keep society stitched together, die for glory, and enjoy intimate moments in a dead and desolate world. The stories we leave behind are the proof of our existence. May the headlights shine bright on the people of Broketown. With the horrifying tyrannical rule of Ragnar Van Money over, a new social order needs to be founded. The Saviors, as they are called, work tirelessly to create a safe home for all those in need, but they have no experience in such matters. Are they capable? Others wonder if a victory won by bloodshed can lead to anything but. The farmers, the Textile Guild, and neighboring populations seem to seek a peaceful balance but resources are limited, people are fearful, and self-serving bandits are around every corner it seems. Not all find themselves bogged down by such conversations and considerations, as they live day to day in dangerous, thrilling careers, protected only by their modded vehicles on the roads once owned by the Metal Masters, slowly crumbling around them as players traverse the treacherous terrain. This is a consent-heavy game influenced by American Freeform. No LARP experience needed, new players welcome. Costumes recommended. (The setting locations are dilapidated cities.) Toy cars, also in costume, optional and recommended if you have one. Yes, that one works. Necessary supplies provided. Character creation done in game. For questions, please email anne.ratchat@gmail.com. </FONT><b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 2:00PM - 6:00PM</FONT></b><FONT COLOR='YELLOW'>; One Round; All Materials Offered.

Taking on roles inspired by these children, players will develop their own sign language. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 11:00AM - 1:00PM</FONT></b>; One Round; All Materials Provided.

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>R096</FONT></b>: Call of Cthulhu, 7th Edition; "Help Wanted" presented by Jo Kreil. The strange events related in this dark tale from legend-haunted Arkham center upon a strange series of 'help wanted' advertisements that have been appearing in the Arkham Advertiser over a period of months. Each advertisement has a very similar, and very odd, style but asks for assistance with a different - but equally specialized - skill. The advertisement runs sporadically for weeks on end, then disappears, only to be replaced with another variant version a few days later. Anyone whose curiosity is piqued by these cryptic "want ads" will find themselves swept up in a most unusual mystery - perhaps one of the weirdest cases of their investigative careers. Why would someone have need of such oddly specific skills? What pattern is there in the serial disappearances? How do these events tie in with unbelievable tales about an 18th Century self-style sorcerer from Arkham's dark past? Investigators are provided but players may bring their own favorite 1920s character. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 8:00PM - 12:00AM</FONT></b>; One Round; All Materials Offered.

The strange events related in this dark tale from legend-haunted Arkham center upon the public health crisis that has swept to the attention of many locals. Some foul taint seems to have settled upon the milk supplies which are delivered daily to thousands of Arkhamites. People have reported vomiting, bleeding... and other, far, stranger symptoms. The authorities have been aiming to keep a lid on it, but a plucky reporter from the Arkham Advertiser has received an 'inside tip' that promises to blow the whole scandal wide open. Authorities are keen to stop the reporter from publishing any follow-ups to his initial story, but it's not as easy as that ... for, the reporter has himself mysteriously gone missing. What shadowy forces are behind the fouling of Arkham's milk supply? Are the local dairies - each scrabbling to establish their "healthful" image - somehow to blame? Or is there something more sinister behind the weird mutations which sufferers of poisoning are starting to display? Investigators are provided.

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>B282</FONT></b>: The Resistance. <a href='http://www.dexposure.com/envoy' target='NEW'>An Envoy Event!</a> The Empire must fall. Our mission must succeed. By destroying their key bases, we will shatter Imperial strength and liberate our people. Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance! Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players' identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Wednesday, 12:00AM - 2:00AM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided. Beginners Welcome; Fun, All Ages.

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>B374</FONT></b>: Giant Rhino Hero. <a href='http://www.dexposure.com/envoy' target='NEW'>An Envoy Event!</a> Players are presented with an incredibly heroic – and regrettably heavy – rhinoceros who is eager to climb a tall building and leap other tall buildings in a single bound. First, though, you need to construct that building. Players each start the game with five roof cards, and they take turns adding walls and roofs to a single building. On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall. Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card. In addition, some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on the tower. Keep your hands steady! The first player to build all of his roof cards wins the game. Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards in hand wins. This event will be played with the GIANT Japanese set! <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 4:00PM - 6:00PM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided. Beginners Welcome; Fun, All Ages.

<img src='/images/lock.gif'> <FONT COLOR='RED'>B396</FONT>: Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar. In this game from Rio Grande, players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots. During a turn, players can either (a) place one or more workers on the lowest visible spot of the gears or (b) pick up one or more workers. When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker. Actions located "later" on the gears are more valuable, so it's wise to let the time work for you - but players cannot skip their turn; if they have all their workers on the gears, they have to pick some up. The game ends after one full revolution of the central Tzolk'in gear.

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>B456</FONT></b>: Second Chance. <a href='http://www.dexposure.com/envoy' target='NEW'>An Envoy Event!</a> Each player starts with a 9x9 grid that they want to fill as completely as possible. To begin the game, everyone receives a different card with a starting tile and marks off its spaces on their grid. Every turn, two puzzle tile cards are revealed, and each player chooses one of them, then marks off squares on their personal grid that match the shape of the image shown on their chosen card. Multiple players can choose the same card. If a player cannot fit either revealed shape into their grid, they get a second chance and reveal one card from the deck just for them. If they can fit this shape in their grid, they do continue normally next round; otherwise they are eliminated from play. The game ends when all players have been eliminated, the deck of puzzle cards has run out, or a player has completely filled their grid. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Thursday, 12:00AM - 2:00AM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided.

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>B526</FONT></b>: Downfall. <a href='http://www.dexposure.com/envoy' target='NEW'>An Envoy Event!</a> In the year 2213, the world order - as it had been known for a century and a half - came to an abrupt end over a 19 day war. The bombs started falling on the third day, and by the 19th day ninety-nine percent of the earth's population was dead or would be soon. Wars and conflicts had raged now and again for decades prior, populations rising up, and the global government seeking to quell the conflict and maintain the status quo. But in the most recent five year period, the conflicts escalated rapidly, and the world order began to come apart—leaders became scared and trigger fingers twitchy. No one knows who pressed the button first, and in the harsh realities of the world that followed, no one cared. What mattered was surviving and, if possible, rebuilding. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 2:00PM - 6:00PM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided.

<img src='/images/lock.gif'> <FONT COLOR='RED'>B546</FONT>: That's Pretty Clever & Twice As Clever. <a href='http://www.dexposure.com/envoy' target='NEW'>An Envoy Event!</a> Two great Stronghold titles combined into one slot. Choose your dice well in That's Pretty Clever to enter them into the matching colored area, put together tricky chain-scoring opportunities, and rack up the points. The dice you don't use are as important as what you do because every die that's smaller than the chosen one can be used by the other players, keeping everyone in the game at all times. Twice As Clever follows the model. Each turn the active player rolls six dice, chooses one of them to mark off a space on their scoring grid, places any dice with lower numbers on the side, then re-rolls any remaining dice. The white die is a joker and can be used as any one of the other five colors. After the active player chooses at most three dice, then the other players chooses one of the set-aside dice for use on their scoring sheet. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 2:00PM - 4:00PM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided.

Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors.

<img src='/images/lock.gif'> <FONT COLOR='RED'>B656</FONT>: High Frontier: Colonization. Players are Earth governments which are racing to put together a functioning space program to extract resources and colonize the other planets, moons, and asteroids in our solar system. Players use water in LEO as currency to bid on space-related patents for thrusters, refineries, and robotics. Putting together a functional craft is not easy, as the heavier the craft becomes, the less maneuverable it is and the more fuel (also water in LEO) the craft will require, so players have to balance useful heavy parts with lighter, less functional parts. Victory points are awarded for successful mineral extractions, and for being the first to reach key technologies and exploration points in the solar system. This expansion to both the first and second editions of High Frontier, includes all the elements of the first edition expansion (now out of print), but adds maps, cards, and playing pieces. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 9:00AM - 1:00PM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided.

Players have to move their silkworms to the optimal spaces so they can feed on the best grass available, while pushing the other players' pieces into less desirable feeding grounds. In this game, players roll dice in order to determine which actions they are allowed to perform during their turn. There are six types of actions available: breeding more silkworms, moving the shepherd or their mastiff, building fences or farms, moving the ookami monster around the board, and - most importantly - getting your silkworms to feed. When silkworms feed, they generate a number of silk points, depending on the type of terrain they are standing on at that moment. These points can be used to modify the outcome of a dice roll, all while keeping in mind that the player with the most silk points at the end of the game wins! <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 9:00AM - 11:00AM</FONT></b>; One Session; All Materials Provided.
