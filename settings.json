In return, game creators are tapping into both the renewed interest in the hobby, and the evocation of nostalgia for this time period. In this panel we'll be exploring this recursive relationship with creators from Kids on Bikes and Rememorex.

You view every human being as part of God and you believe (in theory at least) that all human beings deserve to be treated with equal respect, kindness, and love. This is the context for what happens in May 1737, when a Quaker none of you have ever seen before comes in to your Meeting for Worship and reads a paper denouncing Quaker participation in the Atlantic slave system, which currently forms the foundation of Pennsylvania's economy, where you all live. As Quakers, you are bound by custom to listen to the visitor's arguments and seriously contemplate them before then coming to a group consensus about how to reply to the visitor's antislavery paper. This game was inspired by my doctoral research on the Quakers' relationship to slavery. It is based on actual Quaker practice, and uses silent meditation as its' core game mechanic. While it is a game of debate, it is at heart about the debate that happens in ones' own mind rather than through debating with others.",

Vinyl - Big Band Expansion beams the core mechanisms of Vinyl back to the 1940's. Players will still be using magazine cards to collect vinyl records, but there are a few twists in the core mechanism in order to keep the Vinyl spirit fresh!",

You view every human being as part of God and you believe (in theory at least) that all human beings deserve to be treated with equal respect, kindness, and love. This is the context for what happens in May 1737, when a Quaker none of you have ever seen before comes in to your Meeting for Worship and reads a paper denouncing Quaker participation in the Atlantic slave system, which currently forms the foundation of Pennsylvania's economy, where you all live. As Quakers, you are bound by custom to listen to the visitor's arguments and seriously contemplate them before then coming to a group consensus about how to reply to the visitor's antislavery paper. This game was inspired by my doctoral research on the Quakers' relationship to slavery. It is based on actual Quaker practice, and uses silent meditation as its' core game mechanic. While it is a game of debate, it is at heart about the debate that happens in ones' own mind rather than through debating with others.",

These mentors, former humans themselves, teach them how to project their true selves into the world as CHRYSALISES while they sleep, solving challenges and fighting evils in ways that influence their more mundane daytime lives.

As Quakers, you are bound by custom to listen to the visitor's arguments and seriously contemplate them before then coming to a group consensus about how to reply to the visitor's antislavery paper. This game was inspired by my doctoral research on the Quakers' relationship to slavery. It is based on actual Quaker practice, and uses silent meditation as its' core game mechanic.

These mentors, former humans themselves, teach them how to project their true selves into the world as CHRYSALISES while they sleep, solving challenges and fighting evils in ways that influence their more mundane daytime lives. The goal is to eventually emerge as BUTTERFLIES from their masked self both literally as a celestial being, and figuratively as a neurodivergent, queer person who has embraced who they are. Actions and experiences at night affect characters' lives during the day, and vice versa.

You need to use Cartoon Logic to escape reality and confront your creator. Focus group discussion topics will include: spitballing \"weird\" mechanics and resolution systems; making comedy horrifying and making horror funny; and how to take a weird idea and make a game out of it.",
