You view every human being as part of God and you believe (in theory at least) that all human beings deserve to be treated with equal respect, kindness, and love. This is the context for what happens in May 1737, when a Quaker none of you have ever seen before comes in to your Meeting for Worship and reads a paper denouncing Quaker participation in the Atlantic slave system, which currently forms the foundation of Pennsylvania's economy, where you all live. As Quakers, you are bound by custom to listen to the visitor's arguments and seriously contemplate them before then coming to a group consensus about how to reply to the visitor's antislavery paper. This game was inspired by my doctoral research on the Quakers' relationship to slavery. It is based on actual Quaker practice, and uses silent meditation as its' core game mechanic. While it is a game of debate, it is at heart about the debate that happens in ones' own mind rather than through debating with others.",

Your goal is to ‘leave no trace behind' but this is easier said than done because other players can manipulate your path and the mountain itself is out to get you! Once you reach the peak, you must maintain your balance until all the climbers arrive. This is a BLIND playtest. Players will be expected to read the rules and play the game with no help from the designer.",

You view every human being as part of God and you believe (in theory at least) that all human beings deserve to be treated with equal respect, kindness, and love. This is the context for what happens in May 1737, when a Quaker none of you have ever seen before comes in to your Meeting for Worship and reads a paper denouncing Quaker participation in the Atlantic slave system, which currently forms the foundation of Pennsylvania's economy, where you all live. As Quakers, you are bound by custom to listen to the visitor's arguments and seriously contemplate them before then coming to a group consensus about how to reply to the visitor's antislavery paper. This game was inspired by my doctoral research on the Quakers' relationship to slavery. It is based on actual Quaker practice, and uses silent meditation as its' core game mechanic. While it is a game of debate, it is at heart about the debate that happens in ones' own mind rather than through debating with others.",

Each player is an Earth Archaelogist with a special area of expertise like Earth Languages, Earth Food, Earth Sports, Earth Geography, Earth Politics, etc. On their turn a player will draw a card and announce a nonsense phrase that was discovered during their latest expedition to Earth; something like Cheddar Diploma or Biscuit Cul-de-Sac. Then the other experts who feel qualified will have a discussion about it's meaning. Any expert is encouraged to jump in, discount other experts, etc. However, the expert who's turn it is will ultimately determine the correct answer. Play continues until all the artifacts (cards) are used. At the end of the game the group will create a chart or image as a visual aid to their research on Earth History.",
