Keep society stitched together, die for glory, and enjoy intimate moments in a dead and desolate world. The stories we leave behind are the proof of our existence. May the headlights shine bright on the people of Broketown. With the horrifying tyrannical rule of Ragnar Van Money over, a new social order needs to be founded. The Saviors, as they are called, work tirelessly to create a safe home for all those in need, but they have no experience in such matters. Are they capable? Others wonder if a victory won by bloodshed can lead to anything but. The farmers, the Textile Guild, and neighboring populations seem to seek a peaceful balance but resources are limited, people are fearful, and self-serving bandits are around every corner it seems. Not all find themselves bogged down by such conversations and considerations, as they live day to day in dangerous, thrilling careers, protected only by their modded vehicles on the roads once owned by the Metal Masters, slowly crumbling around them as players traverse the treacherous terrain. This is a consent-heavy game influenced by American Freeform. No LARP experience needed, new players welcome. Costumes recommended. (The setting locations are dilapidated cities.) Toy cars, also in costume, optional and recommended if you have one. Yes, that one works. Necessary supplies provided. Character creation done in game.

Clues will be hidden within tea, food, and atmosphere that, if deciphered, can show you how the boxes might be opened. Each player will automatically be given one opportunity to attempt to open a box. However, players can earn additional opportunities by contributing to the atmosphere through fancy dress, exceptional role play, bringing you own special mug/tea cup, contributing to the entertainment (reading poetry or prose, singing an appropriate song, etc.), or bringing a few extra teabags or snacks to share with the party.",

Those who oppose the system and those who want to break the rules for profit are hunted all the same. Mercenaries, activists, mafiosi, assassins, guerrilla medics and more thrive in the dark places, finding profit, community, and soul in the places where the corporate police state refuses to look. In the heart of Metro City's downtown lies a place where all these \"criminals\" (the good, the bad and the in-between) flock. The Hotel Royale, a hive of scum and villainy that prides itself on providing excellent service - and greasing all the right hands to keep prying eyes away - acts as a sanctuary of sorts for the denizens of the Metro underground. What happens when the limits of that sanctuary are tested? Come check in for a stay at the Hotel Royale. This game is a parlor LARP featuring themes of drugs, violence, and other adult themes.

Your primary mode of expressing your characters will be through role playing sex (players hold hands and verbally describe their characters' actions), because what we do and how we react says a lot about who we are. Poetry in motion is not a pornographic scenario - it's also not about abuse. It's about little but crucial things like loneliness, love and desperate hope, and confused, alienated and amazing people.

In a not-so-distant-future where physical touch is going out of fashion, two couples and a widow quietly rebel by meeting in person to swap partners and explore themselves and each other. Your primary mode of expressing your characters will be through role playing sex (players hold hands and verbally describe their characters' actions), because what we do and how we react says a lot about who we are. Poetry in motion is not a pornographic scenario - it's also not about abuse. It's about little but crucial things like loneliness, love and desperate hope, and confused, alienated and amazing people. NOTE: Contains sexual situations.",

The advertisement runs sporadically for weeks on end, then disappears, only to be replaced with another variant version a few days later. Anyone whose curiosity is piqued by these cryptic \"want ads\" will find themselves swept up in a most unusual mystery - perhaps one of the weirdest cases of their investigative careers. Why would someone have need of such oddly specific skills? What pattern is there in the serial disappearances? How do these events tie in with unbelievable tales about an 18th Century self-style sorcerer from Arkham's dark past?

The authorities have been aiming to keep a lid on it, but a plucky reporter from the Arkham Advertiser has received an 'inside tip' that promises to blow the whole scandal wide open. Authorities are keen to stop the reporter from publishing any follow-ups to his initial story, but it's not as easy as that ... for, the reporter has himself mysteriously gone missing. What shadowy forces are behind the fouling of Arkham's milk supply? Are the local dairies - each scrabbling to establish their \"healthful\" image - somehow to blame? Or is there something more sinister behind the weird mutations which sufferers of poisoning are starting to display? Investigators are provided.

The advertisement runs sporadically for weeks on end, then disappears, only to be replaced with another variant version a few days later. Anyone whose curiosity is piqued by these cryptic \"want ads\" will find themselves swept up in a most unusual mystery - perhaps one of the weirdest cases of their investigative careers. Why would someone have need of such oddly specific skills? What pattern is there in the serial disappearances? How do these events tie in with unbelievable tales about an 18th Century self-style sorcerer from Arkham's dark past?

Some foul taint seems to have settled upon the milk supplies which are delivered daily to thousands of Arkhamites. People have reported vomiting, bleeding... and other, far, stranger symptoms. The authorities have been aiming to keep a lid on it, but a plucky reporter from the Arkham Advertiser has received an 'inside tip' that promises to blow the whole scandal wide open. Authorities are keen to stop the reporter from publishing any follow-ups to his initial story, but it's not as easy as that ... for, the reporter has himself mysteriously gone missing. What shadowy forces are behind the fouling of Arkham's milk supply? Are the local dairies - each scrabbling to establish their \"healthful\" image - somehow to blame? Or is there something more sinister behind the weird mutations which sufferers of poisoning are starting to display? Investigators are provided. Players may bring their favorite 1920s CoC character to play as well if they so choose.",

Players are presented with an incredibly heroic – and regrettably heavy – rhinoceros who is eager to climb a tall building and leap other tall buildings in a single bound. First, though, you need to construct that building. Players each start the game with five roof cards, and they take turns adding walls and roofs to a single building. On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall. Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card. In addition, some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on the tower. Keep your hands steady! The first player to build all of his roof cards wins the game. Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards in hand wins. This event will be played with the GIANT Japanese set!",

The Secretary General calls for calm, but before he can order a recess, his cranium is split as well. The remaining Great Powers use the confusion to pass the gavel between themselves, conduct international business amidst the chaos, and generally try to shift the balance of world power while escaping a bunch of armed psychopaths.",

In the course of a single morning, your village will decide who is a werewolf...because all it takes is lynching one werewolf to win! This event will be played as several rounds, keeping score for each player (winning side or losing side). Each successive round will add more complex characters, which will also be incorporated from the Daybreak expansion.",

When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker. Actions located \"later\" on the gears are more valuable, so it's wise to let the time work for you - but players cannot skip their turn; if they have all their workers on the gears, they have to pick some up.

It's based on a simplistic game that LEGO released (called Heroica), but this version is completely custom and much more involved. The game does not involve building, as everything is pre-constructed, but the LEGO medium allows for a fully 3D game world with multiple layers and moving parts. Don't be fooled into thinking it's just for kids! No prior experience is expected or required, and the game is easily learned as it is played. The Twilight Parish scenario is a stand-alone adventure that has players investigating a graveyard and church to find the cause of a zombie outbreak.",

Like all great PYL games, the rules are simple, with you repeating the Dragon Hunt until you decide to stop. The very interesting twist is the player challenges. The ability to challenge - and rewards for passing or failing when challenged - add a dimension to everything that you do on your turn. What order do you go after dragons? When do you stop? When do you challenge? Who do you challenge? How do you get others not to challenge you?!",

Choose your dice well in That's Pretty Clever to enter them into the matching colored area, put together tricky chain-scoring opportunities, and rack up the points. The dice you don't use are as important as what you do because every die that's smaller than the chosen one can be used by the other players, keeping everyone in the game at all times. Twice As Clever follows the model. Each turn the active player rolls six dice, chooses one of them to mark off a space on their scoring grid, places any dice with lower numbers on the side, then re-rolls any remaining dice. The white die is a joker and can be used as any one of the other five colors. After the active player chooses at most three dice, then the other players chooses one of the set-aside dice for use on their scoring sheet.",

Each turn, you will deploy an alien to the planet whose number corresponds to the number of cards in your hand. Deploying an alien will allow you to manipulate the number of cards in your own hand or your opponent's hand. In order to conquer the most planets and win the game, you will need to balance manipulating your own hand size and your opponent’s hand size controlling where they will deploy on their next turn. The player who can do this will rule the solar system!",

Romans, Barbarians, Egyptians and Japanese all at once move there to expand the boundaries of their empires. They build new buildings to strengthen their economy, they found mines and fields to gather resources, and they build barracks and training grounds to train soldiers. Soon after they discover that this land is far too small for everybody, then the war begins... Imperial Settlers is a card game that lets players lead one of the four factions and build empires by placing buildings, then sending workers to those buildings to acquire new resources and abilities. The game is played over five rounds during which players take various actions in order to explore new lands, build buildings, trade resources, conquer enemies, and thus score victory points.",

As your income increases, you'll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you'll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population).

It's now a fight between you and your (now former) team mates to earn the most tips to land the one server job at the restaurant. Of course, none of you are above surreptitiously using your powers to help you secure the job. The one who earns the most tips will win. That whole crime-fighting can wait till later.

At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players' identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.",

Players are presented with an incredibly heroic – and regrettably heavy – rhinoceros who is eager to climb a tall building and leap other tall buildings in a single bound. First, though, you need to construct that building. Players each start the game with five roof cards, and they take turns adding walls and roofs to a single building. On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall. Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card. In addition, some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on the tower. Keep your hands steady! The first player to build all of his roof cards wins the game. Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards in hand wins. This event will be played with the GIANT Japanese set!",

As you play, you use gold to buy champion cards and action cards from the Market. These champions and actions can generate large amounts of gold, combat, or other powerful effects. You use combat to attack your opponent and their champions. When you reduce your opponent's score (called health) to zero, you win!",

If size and suit match, compare a secondary bid (3 gold and 2 marble beats 3 gold and a silver).",

      "description": "Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck. Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!",

On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall. Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card. In addition, some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on the tower. Keep your hands steady! The first player to build all of his roof cards wins the game. Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards in hand wins. This event will be played with the GIANT Japanese set!",

If a Scenario Card is drawn, the scenario is read aloud and everyone else answers with their most appropriate artist. The white deck also contains Diss Cards. When Diss Cards are played, one player challenges another player to a battle. Using dice that have categories like Flow, Delivery and Bars, players pick their best artist and roll the dice for 3 rounds. Each artist has a score that corresponds with the categories - the best scores out of 3 rounds wins the battle, and of course bragging rights. SWaTS is just the right amount of randomness, personal opinion, trash-talk, strategy, debate and music discovery.",
