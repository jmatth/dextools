<h3>Thursday, November 7 - Sunday, November 10, 2019<br>
At the Hyatt Regency Morristown & Conference Center in Morristown, New Jersey</h3><hr>

<h2>COMPLETE SCHEDULE for METATOPIA 2019</h2>Updated 11/7/19 at 2:30PM EST; ALL emails processed.<p></center>

METATOPIA Event Registration works slightly differently from other Double Exposure events. You may have already gotten an email with events that we've entered for you based on your survey responses, or our general knowledge of you as a player. If we assigned you to something, please note that we'd really appreciate if you could give that game a try (it may be a niche game that we will have trouble getting players for), but IF you feel very strongly that you do not want to playtest it for some reason, please do let us know and suggest an alternative for the slot.<p>

<FONT COLOR="YELLOW">DO NOT WAIT FOR US TO SEND YOU AN EMAIL WITH EVENTS. IF YOU WANT TO SELF-SELECT RIGHT NOW, WE ARE HAPPY TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR CHOICES!!!</FONT><p>

We may end up having several back and forth emails with you to complete your schedule! We are going to work hard to keep the page up to date with events that are filled, but remember that all incoming emails are dealt with in the order in which they are received.<p>

Some of the events are red and have LOCK symbols. There are two reasons why this might be:<p>

1) All of the seats are filled already (check the notes at the end of the event text), and NOBODY ELSE can select this event.<p>

2) It is a HI-TEST. If you have a Designer or Helper Membership, you can request these events (usually). If you have a Player Membership, you can request these events, but note that we MAY reject you.<p>

<FONT COLOR="GREEN">The event listings will be updated periodically - Check the date/time stamp at the top of this page to see when the last update was made. This is a manual, not automatic process. Therefore, while an event might show that it still has seats, it is possible that emails that arrived before yours took those seats already. Your emails are processed in the order they are received, even if that takes place hours after you sent yours. Through the years, several people have haughtily proclaimed that this method is archaic and that we should be automating this process. There is no algorithm in the world that can do what we do to fill these playtests. Trust us.</FONT><p>

All non-panel events are classified as one of three different levels of Playtest:<p>

[FOCUS GROUP]: The game is still in the concept stage and players should be expecting to discuss ideas and opinions about how the game should be created, but not actually test much.<p>

[ALPHA TEST]: The game is in early development and not quite ready to play from beginning to end. Players should be expecting to play parts of the game, and perhaps replay those parts or focus on one section of the rules at a time.<p>

[BETA TEST]: The game is in late development and is ready to be played all the way through. Players should be expecting to give feedback and criticism about the game while playing it.<p>

If an event is tagged by the phrase "[NDA REQUIRED]", the Designer has asked that details about his/her game design be kept quiet. The Designer may ask players to sign an actual NDA form, or to just verbally promise not to discuss the game after the playtest.<p>

<font COLOR="YELLOW">PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR PHONE NUMBER(S) IN YOUR EMAIL SO WE CAN REACH YOU IF NECESSARY!</font><p>

Send eMail to <a href = mailto:m2019@dexposure.com>m2019@dexposure.com</a> with the events you would LIKE to play in, and <font COLOR="YELLOW">PLEASE USE ONLY EVENT CODES IN YOUR EMAIL!</font>. We will then do our best to match you up with the events that you are interested in. There WILL be a Big Board at METATOPIA, and any seats which are not filled in advance CAN be filled at the convention. Note that you DO NOT NEED A BADGE NUMBER - WE IDENTIFY YOU BY NAME AND EMAIL ADDRESS!<p>

You can make event requests until 12:00PM EDT, Thursday, November 7. After that, you must enter your name into events on the Big Board at the convention.<p>

<font COLOR="YELLOW">PLEASE SEND ONLY ONE PERSON'S CODES PER EMAIL. DO NOT COMBINE REQUESTS.</font><p>

You are also encouraged to submit a second and third choice for events in the same time slot, which will save us time in negotiating what you can get into if your primary choice is filled already. Just make it clear what is an alternate choice so we can enter things quickly.<p>

<font COLOR="YELLOW">VERY IMPORTANT: If there are specific times that you DO NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING, please specify those times. If we see holes in your schedule (that are not lunch or dinner breaks), we MAY try to fill them!</font><p>

Also, PLEASE note "D" events (panels and seminars) along with others - it is important that we track interest in the various panels, and that we know where you have holes in your schedule.<p>

Send your reservation eMail to us at <a href = mailto:m2019@dexposure.com>m2019@dexposure.com</a><p>

You may ONLY reserve seats in METATOPIA 2019 events if you are pre-registered. <a href="m2019i.html">Click here to pre-register for METATOPIA 2019</a> if you have not already done so.<p>

We will reply within 24 hours with a confirmation that your requests were received. If you do NOT get a confirmation, assume that your codes are NOT received and try again. Note that you MUST include a valid eMail reply-to address for us to reach you to confirm!<hr>


<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D001</FONT></b>: <FONT COLOR='YELLOW'>"Lean Coffee" presented by Rob Donoghue. The lean coffee is a structured but informal method of conversation. I'll be doing this in lieu of my normal breakfast, and anyone is welcome - if we have more people, we'll spawn more tables. Each table proposes and votes on topics to discuss, and discussion continues as long as there's interest. This is a great way to get a quick but interesting discussion about a topic that has interested you. </FONT><b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 8:00AM - 9:00AM</FONT></b><FONT COLOR='YELLOW'>; Fun, All Ages.</FONT><p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D002</FONT></b>: <FONT COLOR='YELLOW'>"First Time METATOPIA Attendees" presented by Avonelle Wing, Darren Watts. Join Avonelle Wing and others for a METATOPIA orientation. All types of attendees welcome. We'll talk about the philosophy behind this unique convention, answer questions and introduce you to each other. </FONT><b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 9:00AM - 10:00AM</FONT></b><FONT COLOR='YELLOW'>; Serious, All Ages.</FONT><p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D003</FONT></b>: "Distribution And Fulfillment" presented by Jason Walters, Mark Diaz Truman, Brennan Taylor, Christopher Tang. The ways to get your game into the hands of players are always shifting, but our experts can walk you through the three-tier system and the various alternatives to it. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 10:00AM - 11:00AM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D004</FONT></b>: "How To Work With Artists" presented by Jack Parra, Lissanne Lake, Scott Bowmanchester. The panelists will touch on the process of how to find and approach artists, negotiate the contract, and then successfully work together. It's important that publishers get an artist's-eye-view of things so they can better understand what we do, the process, and the time involved and plan projects accordingly. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 10:00AM - 11:00AM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D005</FONT></b>: "How To Playtest Your New Game" presented by Jennifer Gutterman, Peter Hayward, Curt Covert. Join us for a roundtable conversation about how to get the best data from your time at the playtesting table. We'll discuss our experiences running playtests, and talk about common mistakes and how to avoid them. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 10:00AM - 11:00AM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D006</FONT></b>: "Nostalgia as Genre in Gaming" presented by Sean Jaffe, Gia Grillo, Megan Jaffe, Brian Neff. Echoes of the late 20th century are all around us in 2019, especially in pop culture and media.   Stranger Things, IT, and Bandersnatch have tapped into a rich vein of nostalgia that has entranced audience and permeated our time. Gaming, especially tabletop gaming, has been depicted as a vital part of 80s culture. In return, game creators are tapping into both the renewed interest in the hobby, and the evocation of nostalgia for this time period. In this panel we'll be exploring this recursive relationship with creators from Kids on Bikes and Rememorex. We’ll talk role playing and nostalgia, how to evoke an authentic sense of a time period, and what has drawn us as creators back to the past. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 11:00AM - 12:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D007</FONT></b>: "Working with Podcasters for Promotion" presented by Senda Linaugh, Phil Vecchione, Rach Shelkey, James Malloy. Your game is hitting kickstarter or the shelf, and you're blowing up your social media - but how do you get the word out on audio? Sit down with us for a crash course and Q&A on effectively working with podcasters to get your game played on actual plays or be an interviewee that people are excited to listen to. We'll also talk through effective approaches to the symbiotic creator/media relationship and common pitfalls. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 11:00AM - 12:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D008</FONT></b>: "How To Be A Useful Playtester" presented by Mike Roberts, Eric Simon, Julie Ahern. Our panelists talk about how to be good playtesters. Learn how to hear the questions being asked and answer with useful feedback. We all want to give helpful criticism; learn more about how to do that. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 11:00AM - 12:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D009</FONT></b>: "How To Pitch Your Game" presented by Darren Watts, Kenneth Hite, Sydney Engelstein. You made a game! Congratulations! Now explain your incredible game in one sentence. That isn't as easy as it sounds. You want people to buy into your game as players, as investors, or as retailers. You will only have one chance to make that first impression. It needs to have impact. If you want to see your game successful on a crowdfunding site, or sold by your local game store, then you need to know what kind of pitch types and styles to maximize both what you say and target the right audience. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 12:00PM - 1:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D010</FONT></b>: "How To Get The Most Out Of Playtesting At METATOPIA" presented by Brand Robins, Krin Irvine. Maybe you've playtested with your family or your home gaming group. Perhaps you've put your prototype on the table at an UnPub. Those are absolutely valid ways and places to playtest. METATOPIA is a different creature altogether. You might want to consider some tweaks, though, to those models as you come into METATOPIA. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 12:00PM - 1:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D011</FONT></b>: "Dynamic World Building Workshop: From Brainstorming Techniques to Important Questions About Accessibility and Inclusion" presented by Jennifer Gutterman, Kristen Roberts, Hamish Cameron. In this workshop we will take a hands on approach looking at brainstorming and developing dynamic content. This is geared to any world building scenario, but would definitely benefit those who are just starting to think about the worlds the are working within as well as modifying existing worlds to be inclusive and accessible. This workshop is intended to help develop the world you are working within, so it is meant for a wide variety of people at different points in their development process. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 12:00PM - 1:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D012</FONT></b>: "On Failure" presented by Jason Morningstar, Jesse Edwards, Jacqueline Bryk, Alastor Guzman. Failure is baked into any creative discipline, but we rarely discuss it. In this panel we'll discuss our most noteworthy failures and the role failure plays in our process. The goal is to normalize failure and to learn from the occasionally dramatic mistakes of others. It may be funny, it may be sad, but it will definitely be interesting. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 1:00PM - 2:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D013</FONT></b>: "Ask Bob: NPCs as Game Design" presented by Jason Pitre, Beth Rimmels, Rob Donoghue, Shoshana Kessock. Non-player characters are vital to tabletop and live action roleplaying games. They provide companionship, contrast, resources, information, and dramatic conflict with the players. They are the avatars of the setting, and the best tools that a GM has at her disposal. In this panel, we discuss how games can be designed using non-player characters as a key mechanism. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 1:00PM - 2:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D014</FONT></b>: "This Event is All Ages - Kids at Gaming Events" presented by Pattricia Kirsch, Misha Bushyager, Krista White. Kids are gamers too! Also if you allow kids, it's a lot easier for parents to attend your events. Bring your questions, worries, or whatever to chat with folks who have brought kids of various ages to cons, larps, etc. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 1:00PM - 2:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D015</FONT></b>: "Selling Games: Mass vs. Specialty/Hobby" presented by Brian Turtle, Peter Hayward, Avonelle Wing. I fell into games almost by accident back in 1994 when some friends and I created a game called "The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon". We started Endless Games shortly thereafter and the game found a home in the mass market before we knew it. In the 20+ years since, we've been navigating the toy industry and gaming landscape in both mass and specialty. That said, the hobby side of the industry is still somewhat uncharted territory for us. Join us for a discussion of the differences between mass market and hobby sales and what works where. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 2:00PM - 3:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D016</FONT></b>: "Hacking 101" presented by Ryan O'Grady, Shane Harsch, Paul Stefko, Sean G. So you want to include hacking in your game, but you learned everything you know from watching 'Hackers'. Join us for an overview of computer hacking, what it is and isn't, and different approaches to incorporating it into your game. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 2:00PM - 3:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D017</FONT></b>: "Accessing Art World Resources for LARPs and Other Games" presented by Seanna Musgrave, Tim Hutchings, Sharang Biswas. Museums, theaters, arts councils, universities, and all these other wonderful institutions have resources to support art and culture. Hey, games are art and culture so let's try to figure out how to get some of that sweet, sweet grant money for larp like they do in Scandinavia. The panelists will talk about realized projects that interject games into high culture spaces and will speculate on tricks and schemes which might work in the future. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 2:00PM - 3:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D018</FONT></b>: "Making Good Financial Decisions as a Game Designer" presented by Heather O'Neill, Tim Rodriguez, Jennifer Graham-Macht. You are an individual using your hard earned money to invest in your game project. Do you self-publish, Kickstart or attend that convention? You are an indie tabletop company, so you have some budget to work with. What's your next project? Which big conventions do you attend? We will address costs specific to the tabletop gaming industry (self-publishing, Kickstarter, conventions, marketing, etc.) and ways to make decisions on what will benefit you or your company. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 3:00PM - 4:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D019</FONT></b>: "Submitting to Publishers - A Designer's Perspective" presented by Charlie Hoopes, Jessie Edwards, Nick Little. What should you expect when you submit your thoroughly-playtested board game prototype to a publisher? This talk is an opportunity to hear about the triumphs and failures from designers who weathered several "no's" before hearing the "yes" responses that resulted in signed contracts. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 3:00PM - 4:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D020</FONT></b>: "Building a Welcoming Local Gaming Community" presented by Omari Akil, Matt Everhart.

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D021</FONT></b>: "How to Start a Business as a Game Designer" presented by Matthew Escovar, Emily Escovar, Chris O'Neil, Chris Spivey. Our panelists will walk you through the basics of turning your game design hobby into a business. We'll talk about the most cost-efficient ways to register an LLC, open a business bank account, file a trademark and keep track of your expenses for tax season. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 4:00PM - 5:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D022</FONT></b>: "Building Marketing Hooks Into Your Game" presented by Curt Covert, Mark Diaz Truman, Marissa Kelly. Whether you are pitching a publisher or demoing your game for a fan, you are selling what makes your game special. This is ground floor marketing and understanding how to recognize and sell those features, even at the prototype stage will take your game farther, faster. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 4:00PM - 5:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D023</FONT></b>: "How to Produce an RPG Book" presented by Matthew Idler, Nick Haas, Christopher Badell. You have finished designing your game and you have all the marketing planned out but how do you actually make a book? We will discuss the steps involved and demystify the book production process. We will go from word document to completed book and tell you about what you should focus on at each step. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 4:00PM - 5:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D024</FONT></b>: "Time is of the Essence: Countdowns and Clocks in Games" presented by Darren Watts, Stephen Dewey, Paul Stefko. There are many different mechanics for tracking time and progress in games, and our panel speakers will explore all of them in depth. From countdown clocks and stress tracks, to flickering candles and Jenga towers, there's a lot to explore in this family of mechanics. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 5:00PM - 6:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D025</FONT></b>: "The Legal Basics of Game Design" presented by Betsy Rosenblatt, Bob Tarantino. Have you ever wondered what, exactly, you own when you design a game? When you should put a contract in writing? When it's legal to incorporate elements from another game? What the term "public domain" means? What to do if (gods forbid!) you get a cease and desist letter? Intellectual property law professor Betsy Rosenblatt (U.C. Davis School of Law) and entertainment/games lawyer Bob Tarantino (Dentons) give you the basics you need to know about copyright law, trademark law, contract law, licensing, the Open Game License, and much more. We can't give you individual legal advice, but we can answer your questions! <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 5:00PM - 6:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D026</FONT></b>: "Queer World Building" presented by Jennifer Gutterman, Shayna Cook, Julien Legault. Representation of queer characters and environments is important in the ever changing scope of your audience. Simply adding a queer character or element may seem like enough to feel like your are being accessible. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't but there are definitely ways to build in strong world building content that is queer accessible. Let's chat about what queer accessibility in world building really is and what you can do to make your worlds feel welcome. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 5:00PM - 6:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D029</FONT></b>: <FONT COLOR='YELLOW'>"Golden Cobra Announcement" presented by Jason Morningstar, Banana Chan.

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D030</FONT></b>: "Modeling Firearms in RPGs" presented by Shane Harsch, Jim Dagg, Jason Walters. The details surrounding firearms in RPGs are as varied as the arguments about what is the best gun. As closet simulationists we wanted to represent all the characteristics of firearms that matter, but do so in a way that is streamlined and rules light as possible. The result of this research is an understanding for what matters most when modeling this type of violence. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 8:00PM - 9:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D031</FONT></b>: "You Need a Debrief - Emotional Healthcare for LARP" presented by Avonelle Wing. Role playing allows participants to explore sensitive topics.

Participants will leave this session feeling they can add debriefing tools to any game session. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 8:00PM - 9:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D032</FONT></b>: "Creating Mysteries in RPGs" presented by Kenneth Hite, Betsy Rosenblatt, Darren Watts. Mysteries are among the hardest genres to run successfully in tabletop games. How can designers structure stories to meaningfully involve players, guide them to clues and help them put them together to solve a crime without spoonfeeding them? How can GMs control pacing to duplicate the feel of classic whodunits? <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 9:00PM - 10:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

If you're a game designer or runner, one of the things you can do to increase your game's accessibility is to talk to your disabled players about it. But a lot of people don't know how to have that dialogue, and sometimes it feels easier just to ignore it. Join us in this workshop to learn new communication methods, get some background on a few common disabled experiences, and talk through practicing some scenarios.

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D045</FONT></b>: "First Rule of Game Design: Find Your Core" presented by Fertessa Scott, Geoffrey Engelstein, Chris Spivey. It's easy to equate protecting your game to protecting the pieces that make your game, but they are two different things. Having a core that you can return to, no matter how much you add or take away from your game helps with some of the fear that comes along with making big changes to your game. We'll discuss mental tools you can use to combat that fear, as well as the mental blocks that come from not knowing what to do next. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 10:00AM - 11:00AM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D050</FONT></b>: "Designing Games That Don't Focus on Violence" presented by Brand Robins, Bronwyn Friesen, Whitney Delaglio. We are four designers who make games that explore non-violent design from different angles. In a hobby that originally evolved from war gaming, RPGs without mechanics for violence are still seen as "weird" or "niche" games, to the point that people often have trouble imagining what games without violence could look like. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 11:00AM - 12:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>D075</FONT></b>: "Board Game Components Reality Check" presented by Nick Haas, Nick Little. Publishers and designers frequently need a reality check on what they can produce. On one side of the spectrum there are folks that want a Gloomhaven level of components for Settlers of Catan pricing or a very complex set of materials that would play better as software. (Can't make an abacus to launch a rocket.) On the other side of the spectrum are people that are breaking the mold too much (though those are the fun ones.).There's usually a good reason you haven't seen something from mass production yet; it's usually because a machine doesn't exist or the business isn't integrated enough to do so. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 9:00PM - 10:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

Can we get nitty gritty with players and talk about science? Can we as designers build science into our games in fun ways that do not lend themselves to sci- fiction but a truer representation and reflection of our current or past understandings of the way our universe, our earth works? We will be talking about how we designed Starry Messenger, The Moon Stares at Us in Shame, and Magischola with science in mind and their usage and representations of science. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 10:00PM - 11:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages.<p>

<b><FONT COLOR='RED'> [FILLED] L138</FONT></b>: <FONT COLOR='BLUE'>[BETA TEST]</FONT> "By This Craft We Have Our Wealth: A Game about Quakers and Slavery" presented by Kate Freedman. You are all Quakers. You view every human being as part of God and you believe (in theory at least) that all human beings deserve to be treated with equal respect, kindness, and love. This is the context for what happens in May 1737, when a Quaker none of you have ever seen before comes in to your Meeting for Worship and reads a paper denouncing Quaker participation in the Atlantic slave system, which currently forms the foundation of Pennsylvania's economy, where you all live. As Quakers, you are bound by custom to listen to the visitor's arguments and seriously contemplate them before then coming to a group consensus about how to reply to the visitor's antislavery paper. This game was inspired by my doctoral research on the Quakers' relationship to slavery. It is based on actual Quaker practice, and uses silent meditation as its' core game mechanic. While it is a game of debate, it is at heart about the debate that happens in ones' own mind rather than through debating with others. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 11:00AM - 1:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, 18 & Over ONLY. <FONT COLOR='PURPLE'>*This game will be self-published or is already signed*</FONT><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'> There are 0 seats left.</FONT><p>

Save the last living person you care for, or save the future of humanity itself. You know what you would do, but what does your Character do? The game of Align looks to answer that question. Align is a D6 dice pool system that brings a Character's own story and ambitions to the forefront. Instead of attributes like Strength and Dexterity, a Character's ability stems from their history, their Drives and Alignment; what guides their decisions in that very moment. Align works to establish how a Character's identity affects their actions, and highlight the situations where Characters can achieve great things alongside, or in spite of, their fellow allies. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Friday, 4:00PM - 6:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, All Ages. <FONT COLOR='PURPLE'>*This game will be self-published or is already signed*</FONT><FONT COLOR='RED'> This is a HI-TEST session.</FONT><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'> There are 2 seats left.</FONT><p>

And philosophically it denotes a philosophical puzzle or a state of puzzlement. A striking, geometric, deep-stained walnut game board beckons guests to its curious puzzle. Hand-turned Corian pawns stand at the ready for their twin masters, who must work together to reunite these pawns on a single platform. Friends turn foes in Aporia, a puzzle that challenges strategy, memory, and the limits of spatial intelligence. Simple, consistent rules make this puzzle game a dramatic, interactive centerpiece in a home or office. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 9:00AM - 11:00AM</FONT></b>; Serious, 18 & Over ONLY. <FONT COLOR='PURPLE'>*This game will be self-published or is already signed*</FONT><FONT COLOR='RED'> This is a HI-TEST session.</FONT><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'> There are 4 seats left.</FONT><p>

<b><FONT COLOR='GREEN'>L483</FONT></b>: <FONT COLOR='BLUE'>[BETA TEST]</FONT> "By This Craft We Have Our Wealth: A Game about Quakers and Slavery" presented by Kate Freedman. You are all Quakers. You view every human being as part of God and you believe (in theory at least) that all human beings deserve to be treated with equal respect, kindness, and love. This is the context for what happens in May 1737, when a Quaker none of you have ever seen before comes in to your Meeting for Worship and reads a paper denouncing Quaker participation in the Atlantic slave system, which currently forms the foundation of Pennsylvania's economy, where you all live. As Quakers, you are bound by custom to listen to the visitor's arguments and seriously contemplate them before then coming to a group consensus about how to reply to the visitor's antislavery paper. This game was inspired by my doctoral research on the Quakers' relationship to slavery. It is based on actual Quaker practice, and uses silent meditation as its' core game mechanic. While it is a game of debate, it is at heart about the debate that happens in ones' own mind rather than through debating with others. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 2:00PM - 4:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, 18 & Over ONLY. <FONT COLOR='PURPLE'>*This game will be self-published or is already signed*</FONT><FONT COLOR='RED'> ***ONLY ONE SEAT LEFT!***</FONT><p>

An unapologetically queer, neurodivergent game in the magical girl genre. It is both literally and metaphorically about recognizing the masking queer and neurodivergent people do to fit into societies that don't accept them for who they are and coming to accept their true selves. Players will create characters who start out as metaphorical CATERPILLARS, masking their true selves, but whose potential shines brightly enough to attract celestial mentors. These mentors, former humans themselves, teach them how to project their true selves into the world as CHRYSALISES while they sleep, solving challenges and fighting evils in ways that influence their more mundane daytime lives. The goal is to eventually emerge as BUTTERFLIES from their masked self both literally as a celestial being, and figuratively as a neurodivergent, queer person who has embraced who they are. Actions and experiences at night affect characters' lives during the day, and vice versa. Expect playing card and dice mechanics, "episode" and "season"-like session structures, and lots of color and card suit symbolism. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 2:00PM - 4:00PM</FONT></b>; Fun, 18 & Over ONLY. <FONT COLOR='PURPLE'>*This game will be self-published or is already signed*</FONT><FONT COLOR='RED'> This is a HI-TEST session.</FONT><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'> There are 0 seats left.</FONT><p>

A hack of "For the Queen" in which players take on the roles of non-binary characters who belong to a family in which only the women transform into werewolves. Throughout the game, characters explore their relationships to gendered spaces and family tradition.

Content Warnings: Potential misgendering by NPCs (all players have control over whether their own character is misgendered by family members or not), bigotry (transphobia, homophobia, sexism) primarily in the form of microaggressions, family strife, estrangement from family, isolation, potential emotional abuse, gender stereotypes, dysphoria, and discussions of bodies and the way characters relate to their bodies. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Saturday, 4:00PM - 6:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, 18 & Over ONLY.<FONT COLOR='RED'> This is a HI-TEST session.</FONT><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'> There are 0 seats left.</FONT><p>

<img src='/images/lock.gif'><b><FONT COLOR='RED'> L681</FONT></b>: <FONT COLOR='BLUE'>[BETA TEST]</FONT> "By This Craft We Have Our Wealth: A Game about Quakers and Slavery" presented by Kate Freedman. You are all Quakers. You view every human being as part of God and you believe (in theory at least) that all human beings deserve to be treated with equal respect, kindness, and love. This is the context for what happens in May 1737, when a Quaker none of you have ever seen before comes in to your Meeting for Worship and reads a paper denouncing Quaker participation in the Atlantic slave system, which currently forms the foundation of Pennsylvania's economy, where you all live. As Quakers, you are bound by custom to listen to the visitor's arguments and seriously contemplate them before then coming to a group consensus about how to reply to the visitor's antislavery paper. This game was inspired by my doctoral research on the Quakers' relationship to slavery. It is based on actual Quaker practice, and uses silent meditation as its' core game mechanic. While it is a game of debate, it is at heart about the debate that happens in ones' own mind rather than through debating with others. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Sunday, 10:00AM - 12:00PM</FONT></b>; Serious, 18 & Over ONLY. <FONT COLOR='PURPLE'>*This game will be self-published or is already signed*</FONT><FONT COLOR='RED'> This is a HI-TEST session.</FONT><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'> There are 2 seats left.</FONT><p>

An unapologetically queer, neurodivergent game in the magical girl genre. It is both literally and metaphorically about recognizing the masking queer and neurodivergent people do to fit into societies that don't accept them for who they are and coming to accept their true selves. Players will create characters who start out as metaphorical CATERPILLARS, masking their true selves, but whose potential shines brightly enough to attract celestial mentors. These mentors, former humans themselves, teach them how to project their true selves into the world as CHRYSALISES while they sleep, solving challenges and fighting evils in ways that influence their more mundane daytime lives. The goal is to eventually emerge as BUTTERFLIES from their masked self both literally as a celestial being, and figuratively as a neurodivergent, queer person who has embraced who they are. Actions and experiences at night affect characters' lives during the day, and vice versa. Expect playing card and dice mechanics, "episode" and "season"-like session structures, and lots of color and card suit symbolism. <b><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'>Sunday, 12:00PM - 2:00PM</FONT></b>; Fun, 18 & Over ONLY. <FONT COLOR='PURPLE'>*This game will be self-published or is already signed*</FONT><FONT COLOR='ORANGE'> There are 0 seats left.</FONT><p>
