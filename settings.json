Students were then asked to reflect on their character, their decisions, and the subsequent outcomes. In this forum, we discuss the activity and the management topics (e.g., decision making, individual differences, resources) it allowed us to teach using games as experiential learning techniques.",

We hope to provide thoughtful discussion for those new to the topic (both in design and playing) and those who wish to continue the conversation around designing LARPs with non-monogamous relationships.
