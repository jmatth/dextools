Specifically looking at the 8-9th century's, CiS explores the melting pot that was Proto-Scotland- Celtic tribes, a receding Roman empire leaving Moorish and African soldiers stranded, a mythical cult to Mythras, Viking traders and many more cultures met in these rain stricken mountains. Yet, we hardly know about any of this, because so much of Scotland's history has been dictated by armchair white historians. This round table would talk about a lot of the issues in Scottish history, as well as shed light on exciting and new discoveries that make the period ideal to re-explore and understand through the lived experiences of role playing games. We'll also aim to talk about (mis)representation, both in games and in history!",

      "description": "We love touching and feeling games, so how can we be more mindful of sensory experiences and intentional about including little ones with sensory difficulties in gaming? Hear perspectives from a clinician who uses games as part of nontraditional play therapy with 2 to 5 year olds, a parent who uses games and game pieces for toddler sensory needs and social development, and a game designer who creates games with preschooler sensory needs in mind. We will also discuss how to notice and meet sensory needs in children (and yourself!). Grab some dice or game components for your own sensory input during the panel!",

The games we create are no less an art form, and we designers no less than artists. What we craft brings people together for a shared experience and has the ability to do more than challenge us mentally, pass the time or entertain, but to connect emotionally with people. Let us view game design through an artistic lens, to look past the mathematical underpinnings, and dive into what makes games a uniquely human endeavor.",
