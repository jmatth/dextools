The Clowns have very short memories - they always wake up to a brand new world. Now, the Circus - their purpose and home - has left. The Salesman enters to offer language and independence in return for their dreams about the Circus and their painfully important relationships to one another. The Clowns will have to decide whether to take the easy way out with the Salesman, or whether to stay, despite their difficulties, and wait for the Circus to return. Clown noses, mirrors, and string (for making tangled, snarled relationships with other clowns) will be provided.",

With no radio or other means of communicating with the outside world, it is unclear to all of you whether this is a drill, a mistake, or the real deal. As the hours pass and the possibility of nuclear annihilation grows more real, will you open up to people you never thought you would trust, dismantle the school's social hierarchy as you know it, and say all the things you meant to keep secret?",

At our DREAMATION playtest, join the Huldufolk in the ghost mining town of Centralia, PA. The Huldufolk's Banished are still nostalgic over luring the town's residents into starting the underground mine fire which still burns decades later, though today only tourists and a few holdout families can be found there. The Huldufolk now return to investigate growing stories of disappearances around the abandoned mines, with rumors that the fires below are glowing hotter than ever before. The Hidden People will need to deal with whatever is growing in Centralia before mortals take a closer look, and decide the old town's future, if there is one.

I will run this module with a few of my own twists, using the Red Box Basic D&D (Moldvay) gave me my start in gaming in 1981. I love it and think you will, too. We'll use those rules and dig into the Expert rules as you crest 4th level. Everyone will make up a character, rules as written. It's fast and easy. If your character dies (and characters will die), you can make another and jump back in. You're welcome even if you know the module like the back of your hand, or if you've never played an RPG before. I'll let you level up much faster than you usually would, too. Feel free to play in multiple sessions! I'll keep continuity between games and you can play as little or as much as you like. If you want, you can even come to the table late. Drop in, drop out. If there's room at the table, you're welcome to play.",

I will run this module with a few of my own twists, using the Red Box Basic D&D (Moldvay) gave me my start in gaming in 1981. I love it and think you will, too. We'll use those rules and dig into the Expert rules as you crest 4th level. Everyone will make up a character, rules as written. It's fast and easy. If your character dies (and characters will die), you can make another and jump back in. You're welcome even if you know the module like the back of your hand, or if you've never played an RPG before. I'll let you level up much faster than you usually would, too. Feel free to play in multiple sessions! I'll keep continuity between games and you can play as little or as much as you like. If you want, you can even come to the table late. Drop in, drop out. If there's room at the table, you're welcome to play.",

      "description": "Explore the classic Basic D&D module, B2: KEEP ON THE BORDERLANDS, written in 1979. Considered a seminal example of adventure module design, \"B2\" introduces the Castellan's Keep as a sort of home base, a dangerous wilderness around it, and the perilous megadungeon called The Caves of Chaos. I will run this module with a few of my own twists, using the Red Box Basic D&D (Moldvay) gave me my start in gaming in 1981. I love it and think you will, too. We'll use those rules and dig into the Expert rules as you crest 4th level. Everyone will make up a character, rules as written. It's fast and easy. If your character dies (and characters will die), you can make another and jump back in. You're welcome even if you know the module like the back of your hand, or if you've never played an RPG before. I'll let you level up much faster than you usually would, too. Feel free to play in multiple sessions! I'll keep continuity between games and you can play as little or as much as you like. If you want, you can even come to the table late. Drop in, drop out. If there's room at the table, you're welcome to play.",

In this political urban fantasy RPG that's Powered by the Apocalypse, you'll play a character caught up in the struggles and intrigue of the supernatural communities in a fictional version of modern-day Cleveland. We will do a lot of the relationship-building and scenario framing collaboratively at the beginning of the session, then play to find out what happens when your characters get caught in the web of whatever dark and nefarious deeds are going on at the Whiskey Island Entertainment District on the lakefront. This game tends to contain mature content and I like to tug at your emotions, so be prepared for that kind of play experience. X-Card and other safety tools will be used and explained before play.",

The Earth Guard Force (EGF) is tasked with keeping an eye on the Bactarans. In 2095, a vessel was reported missing in the vicinity of a Bactaran mine on the small (6km wide) asteroid 951 Gaspra. Your ship, the EGF frigate Scythe, has been dispatched to investigate. In 2101, after years of fighting in the asteroid belt, the conflict is coming to a head at Ceres, where a Bactaran ship has blown through the blockade and must be stopped before it can make it to the warp bridge around Saturn.

This game has some heavy overtones but also has the potential for humorous, hopeful, and heartfelt moments. It is greatly indebted to Jackson Tegu's \"Morning\" in that the game is played out in brief, unconnected glimpses and impressions throughout the unbound's first day out. Sprawling narrative and fantastical occurrences are absent, replaced by brief flashes of emotion, sensation, and thought. First Day Out is a meditative game about sensing the real world in new, bewildering ways.",

The order of the swimmers is determined by simultaneously playing cards face-down then revealing the values. The number on each player's card determines position in line (higher numbers in front, lower numbers in back), however ties don't move. The swimmer at the back loses a limb to the shark and is flung to the front of the line! The process is repeated until only two swimmers remain on the table. When this happens, the swimmer at the front of the line wins the game!",

On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall. Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card. In addition, some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on the tower. Keep your hands steady! The first player to build all of his roof cards wins the game. Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards in hand wins. This event will be played with the GIANT Japanese set!",

Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance! Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players' identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.",

Players have to repay all their loans before the game ends, but need to worry only about how much poverty they're creating relative to the other players. Brass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes.",

Each round you draw three unit coins from your bag, then take turns using them to perform actions. Each coin shows a military unit on one side and can be used for one of several actions.

The other players then decide if they want to violate the edict by doing the opposite of what it commands. So \"Don't take any Medicis\" suddenly becomes \"I must take all the Medicis\". Committing a sin can be challenging, but a player attempting it gets the benefit of the indulgence, a token that turns one of their cards into a winning hand. Can you trick your opponents into committing sins without the indulgence? Can you avoid sinning yourself? Whoever can pull that off will end up with a pile of gems and the title of victor.",

On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall. Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card. In addition, some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on the tower. Keep your hands steady! The first player to build all of his roof cards wins the game. Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards in hand wins.

Players bet on the horses before each race and so either co-operate or compete to get their horses over the line.",

This Mayday title features a funky box-shaped device covered with cardboard tokens, and this device comes loaded with two hundred double-sided cards, with each card featuring a black-and-white line drawing. On a turn, a player rolls the two dice, then removes one or two tokens from the box that match the numbers rolled. When you remove a token, you see through a hole in the box that reveals part of the topmost line drawing. If the player wants, they can guess what the drawing represents, after which they pull the card out of the box to see whether they are correct, scoring points based on the number of tokens removed if correct and losing points otherwise. After ten rounds, the player with the most points wins.",

This means a much lower price as well as easier transportation and setup, but don't be fooled - this is not a \"light\" war game or a CCG. This will be a multi-player per side event where the game will be at least double the size of a typical Battleground game for maximum carnage!",

The 91st barely managed to fight its way through the Ghost Bear lines to link up with the 103rd in order to defend the city. As the Com Guards attempted to deploy throughout Spanac, Alpha continued to pound the 91st. The Ghost Bear Khans were determined to seize ComStar's supply caches in order to gain enough parts and ammunition to keep their offensive going. When a Clan aerospace recon flight reported a lightly guarded supply depot near the edge of the city, the Bears quickly moved to seize it.",

As your town grows, you'll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you'll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you'll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population). During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost – and the buildings available in each game vary, so you'll never play the same game twice!",

Players are presented with an incredibly heroic – and regrettably heavy – rhinoceros who is eager to climb a tall building and leap other tall buildings in a single bound. First, though, you need to construct that building. Players each start the game with five roof cards, and they take turns adding walls and roofs to a single building. On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall. Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card. In addition, some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on the tower. Keep your hands steady! The first player to build all of his roof cards wins the game. Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards in hand wins. This event will be played with the GIANT Japanese set!",

Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: To reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.",
